was soft and obese  mild tenderness of the inferior aspect of her ostomy stoma  no rebound tenderness was noted  the stoma color was normal  there was gas and stool in the stoma bag  her midline

abdomen showed a 6 cm x 2 cm left-sided intraabdominal fluid collection and a 4 2 cm fluid collection around the stoma   which both were seemed to as consistent with abscess formation  hospital course  the patient was admitted to the windreal claall onli medical center surgical service on 1/12/05 for management of her intraabdominal abscesses as a complication of recently performed partial colectomy and hartmann pouch for perforated diverticulitis  she was started on iv antibiotics with vancomycin   levofloxacin   and flagyl  by systems  neuro  the patient had intermittent issues with pain control   which were managed by putting the patient on oral narcotic agents as well as fentanyl patch  this seemed to help the patient's pain  the patient also had an episode of altered mental status   which was believed to be due to pulmonary issues of co2 retention as noted below  for this reason   the patient had been transferred to the icu for 24-hour period observation   and at the time of discharge   the patient was in adequate mental status communicating effectively and at her baseline  otherwise   no issues at the time of discharge   except for pain control   being managed by narcotic agents  cardiovascular  the patient was stable throughout her hospitalization  however   it was notable at the time of her previous admission that the patient would need to undergo an echocardiogram within one to two weeks  for this reason   the patient underwent an echocardiogram during her hospitalization and was found to have normal ejection fraction of 65%  there were no regional wall motion abnormalities noted  her aortic valve showed trace aortic insufficiency and the patient also had mild degree of aortic stenosis with the valve of 1 4 cm squared  her mitral valve was shown to have some degree of mitral regurgitation and the patient also had some tricuspid regurgitation as well  her right ventricle was seemed to be okay and she did have some evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy  no evidence of gross cardiac dysfunction  pulmonary  the patient on hospital day #6 was found to have altered mental status in the evening  an abg was checked   which showed a ph of 7 42   pco2 of 61   and po2 of 58   92% oxygen saturation on 3 to 4 liters with the base access of 12  for this reason   it was determined that the patient would need to be admitted to the surgical icu for further monitoring of her pulmonary status  she was taken to the icu and admitted there  during her icu course   the patient was placed on bipap   which effectively brought her bicarbonate and her pco2 levels down  this did effectively decrease her pco2  hence by hospital day #8   the patient was transferred back to the floor in stable condition  from her pulmonary standpoint   the patient continued to have some degree of bibasilar crackles during her hospitalization  however   given her otherwise stable status   the patient was encouraged to perform and sent to spirometry and lasix was withheld during the later course of her hospital course  at the time of discharge   the patient was with adequate oxygen saturation sating 97% on 1 liter at the time of discharge  gi  the patient had no trouble eating regular diet during her hospital course  her ostomy continued to function well with the stoma pink and healthy  she did have two intraabdominal abscesses   which were drained on hospital day #2 by interventional radiology  two ir catheters were placed and these were left in place until the output was deemed to be minimal   and a ct scan was performed as well as an abscessogram   both of which reveled that the fluid collections had resolved  hence on hospital day #10   the patient's interventional radiology drains were discontinued without complications  at the time of discharge   the patient was stable with a soft abdomen and no evidence of infection  the patient did have a midline abdominal incision open with pink granulation tissue   healing well  the pain was treated with wet-to-dry normal saline dressing   b i d  to t i d  gu  the patient continued to have good urine output during her hospital course  she did require foley placement from adequate monitoring of her urine output at 1 8  urinalysis   as well as urine culture was sent   which revealed yeast greater than 100   000 yeast   not candida albicans  she was started on a five-day course of fluconazole and her foley catheter was discontinued for treatment of this infection  at the time of discharge   the patient was urinating adequate amounts independently without any issues  heme  the patient's hematocrit remained stable during her hospital course  however   during her stay in the icu   hematocrit was found to be 27 and the patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells without any complications or events  at the time of discharge   the patient's hematocrit was found to be 43 without any event  she continued to receive subcutaneous heparin t i d  for dvt prophylaxis  id  the patient was placed on vancomycin   levofloxacin   and flagyl during her hospital course for the intraabdominal abscesses  fluconazole was also added for the treatment of a urinary tract infection with the yeast  the antibiotics were continued until the drains were removed on hospital day #10  on hospital day #10   the patient was transitioned to levofloxacin   which is to be continued for a 10-day total course benign 1/27/05   10 further days of levofloxacin required for adequate covered  however   it should be noted that the ir drains were found to be negative and only revealed purulent fluid  gram stain was indicative of sterile purulent fluid  cultures were negative  tubes   lines   and drains  as noted above   the patient had the placement of two interventional radiology drains   which were discontinued prior to discharge  at the time of discharge   the patient has no foley and no ir drains in place  medications at the time of discharge
